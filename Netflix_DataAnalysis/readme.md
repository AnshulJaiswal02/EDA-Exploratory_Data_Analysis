# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üçø

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Netflix content, utilizing a dataset of Netflix titles as of November 2019. The goal of this project is to uncover interesting trends, patterns, and insights into the types of content available on the platform, its growth over time, and key contributors like directors and countries.

## üéØ Project Goals

The main objectives of this EDA project are to:

* Understand the distribution of **content types** (Movies vs. TV Shows).

* Identify the **top countries** producing content for Netflix.

* Discover the most prolific **directors and cast members**.

* Analyze the distribution of **content ratings**.

* Examine the **trend of content additions** to Netflix over the years.

* Identify the **most popular genres**.

## üíæ Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `netflix_titles_nov_2019.csv`. It contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including:

* `show_id`: Unique identifier for each title.

* `title`: Title of the movie or TV show.

* `director`: Director(s) of the content.

* `cast`: Main cast members.

* `country`: Country of production.

* `date_added`: Date the content was added to Netflix.

* `release_year`: Original release year of the content.

* `rating`: Content rating (e.g., TV-MA, TV-14).

* `duration`: Duration (e.g., "93 min" for movies, "1 Season" for TV shows).

* `listed_in`: Genres/categories.

* `description`: Brief synopsis.

* `type`: Type of content (Movie or TV Show).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries

This project is developed using **Python** and leverages the following libraries:

* **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

* **matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

* **seaborn**: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics based on matplotlib.

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before analysis, the raw data underwent several cleaning and preparation steps:

* **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with missing `date_added` and `rating` were dropped. Missing `director`, `cast`, and `country` values were imputed with 'Unknown'.

* **Date Transformation**: The `date_added` column was converted to datetime objects, and `year_added` and `month_added` columns were extracted for time-series analysis.

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Key Insights

The EDA revealed several interesting insights into Netflix's content library:

### Content Type Distribution
